# nvim config

## About

These are my configuration files for neovim. I like to keep it lightweight, so
there are only a few small essential plugins. The config files aren't long and
are commented, so you can read through them yourself and understand what
they're doing.

## How to use

Install neovim. Then install [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Finally clone this repo, copy the files to `~/.config/nvim` and you should be
ready to go.

Oh yea, also remap Caps to Esc on a system level lol.
